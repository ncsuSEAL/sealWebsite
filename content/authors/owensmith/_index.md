I am a current first year PhD student within SEAL and the broader Center for Geospatial Analytics at NCSU.
My work can be distilled into the following word soup:
"_Can we employ the principles of spatial scale to create flexible hierarchical data structures that better match the spatiotemporal scale of phenomena on Earth's surface, reduce redundant compute, and manage the increasing amount of remote sensing data?_"
