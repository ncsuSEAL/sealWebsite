I am currently a PhD candidate (!) here at SEAL, focusing on how we can both quickly and accurately identify deforestation from multi-source satellite data in north-central Myanmar. Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary is one of the last strongholds for the Eld's deer (thamin), whose habitat of tropical dry forest is also under threat in the region. My goal with the research is to help the Smithsonian and NGO staff in Chatthin mitigate deforestation in the region. Specifically, I'm developing a non-intensive combination of satellite sensor data using multiobjective optimization and Bayesian methods, whose results I later hope to use to inform studies using animal tracking data. Please see my <a href = "https://ianmcgregor.netlify.app/"> personal website </a>for more information.
