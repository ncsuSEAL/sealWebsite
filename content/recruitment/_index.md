## **Postdoc in remote sensing at NC State University**

A postdoctoral research position in remote sensing is available in the Spatial Ecosystem Analytics Lab (PI: Dr. Josh Gray) at NC State University. The ideal candidate will have extensive experience with technical remote sensing (i.e., algorithm development), strong computational skills (R and/or Python preferred) and experience working with massive datasets in a distributed computing environment, hydrologic and or ecosystem modeling experience, and a fundamental interest in using remote sensing to understand large-scale Earth system changes.

The Spatial Ecosystem Analytics Lab at NC State is focused on characterizing continental- to global-scale changes in Earth’s vegetation, and understanding how these changes interact with the carbon, water, and climate systems. Specific areas of research include image time series analysis, image fusion, land surface phenology, agricultural intensification, and ecohydrologic modeling. The lab is located in NC State University’s [College of Natural Resources](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/), specifically the [Department of Forestry and Natural Resources](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/fer/), and the innovative [Center for Geospatial Analytics](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/).

NC State is an R1 (Very High Research Activity) university with a strong commitment to the land-grant mission. Along with Duke and UNC Chapel Hill, NC State forms one of the corners of the Research Triangle, a dynamic area home to many start-ups and high-tech companies, particularly in the biotech sector. The area boasts a high standard of living and cultural and recreational opportunities at a relatively low cost.
Competitive salary and benefits are available for up to three years. While this funding is not tied to a particular externally funded research project, the postdoctoral scholar will be expected to support and contribute to a variety of existing and planned projects related to the following: remotely sensed land surface phenology, hydrologic consequences of agricultural intensification, satellite image fusion, and climate adaptive agriculture, among others.
Please submit inquiries to Dr. Josh Gray (josh_gray@ncsu.edu). Formal applications should include a CV, brief statement of research interest, and representative publications.
